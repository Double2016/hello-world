# hello-world
Hi humans!

I feel a little bit awkward and really afraid because i am totally new to learn all these stuffs.
Although i have spent 3 years in my university and i am going to graduate,i feel very ashamed that i didn't manage anything practical and useful. 
Whatever starting to learn and holding on are more meaningul than quitting.
